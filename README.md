# SpaceCraft-Game
# Project Description

This project is my first major coding project which completed in 2020. I was not allowed to use functions, and I ended up mixing everything together. I am sharing it here to demonstrate my progress.

This project is a spaceship game. The player controls a spaceship and navigates through a field of stars, aiming to destroy enemy stars by shooting at them. The objective of the player is to destroy all enemy stars and complete the game. At the end of the game, the player's score is calculated and displayed on the screen.

The project is developed using the Python programming language. The player is expected to input moves such as moving the spaceship right, left, or shooting from the keyboard. Based on the player's moves, the spaceship and stars will move accordingly. The game ends when the spaceship collides with a star or destroys all enemy stars.

# Installation
Download or clone the project files into a directory.

Install Python 3.x on your computer if it is not already installed.

Open the command line and navigate to the project directory.

Start the game by running the following command

python spacecraft_game.py

# How to Play
When the game starts, a game board will be displayed on the screen. The spaceship is represented by the symbol "@" and the stars are represented by "*".
The player can input commands from the keyboard, such as "right" to move right, "left" to move left, or "fire" to shoot.
The spaceship moves to the right when the "right" command is entered.
The spaceship moves to the left when the "left" command is entered.
The spaceship shoots when the "fire" command is entered. The fired laser moves upwards and destroys enemy stars upon collision.
As the game progresses, the spaceship and enemy stars move.
The game ends if the spaceship collides with a star or destroys all enemy stars.
At the end of the game, the player's score is displayed on the screen.
